This repository contains supplementary material and custom scripts of "Questionable Quantifiability: A Multi-Metric, Multi-Dataset Evaluation of Brain Entropy in Altered States of Consciousness"
Master Thesis by Olivier P. de Winter, Student of the Cognitive Neuroscience track of the Psychology Research Master at Leiden University.

This project consisted of a rigorous evaluation of two different brain entropy metrics on fMRI data of a wide range of altered states of consciousness. 
The aim was to test the claims made by the entropic brain hypothesis (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris, 2018): that psychedelics increase entropy and that qualitatively different altered states 
correspond to quantitative levels of entropy.

It contains the following documents:
- Full DCC Results (DCC_fullresults_EBEASC_OdeWinter)
- Custom script used for extracting, preprocessing, and preparing resting-state fMRI data (will be uploaded soon)
- Custom script for statistical analysis (EBEASC_Analysis_OdeWinter_062025)
